# Installation
Follow the steps below to install BAAC:

### Preliminary Step
Be sure you have the Java Runtime Environment installed on your computer.  It can be downloaded from [here](https://www.java.com/en/download/) and there is also a link on the page to check whether you already have the JRE installed if you're unsure

### Primary Steps

1. Download ```BabyGotBAAC.zip``` from [url here]
2. Open the folder where the file was downloaded (typically the Downloads folder)
3. Right click on the zip file and choose the Extract/Unzip option, and choose a destination for the file (we recommend your desktop for easy access!)
4. Once the file is finished unzipping, installation is complete and you're ready to play!

#### Notes
BAAC is written in Java and should be compatible with any operating system.  If you have trouble running the program, visit [Java's website](https://www.java.com/en/download/) to make sure you have the newest version installed
