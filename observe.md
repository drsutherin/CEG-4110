# Observing a Game
From the lobby, you can choose the Observe Game menu option to observe an ongoing game.  When you select Observe Game, you will be shown a list of all active games that you can observe.  Once you've chosen a game to observe, you will be taken to the On Table screen.  You will see a game board and an in-game menu.  
The game board will show the current state of the game being played, and will be automatically updated as the players make moves.  You cannot interact with the game board while observing a game.

### In-Game Menu
The in-game menu has only two options: Start Private Chat and Exit Game.  You can start a private chat with any player logged in to the server at any point.  See the [Chatting](chat.md) page for more info.  
You can also exit the current game at any time and you will be taken back to the lobby.
