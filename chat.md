# Chatting in BAAC
There are two ways to chat with other users while using BAAC: lobby chats and private chats, described in more detail below.

### Lobby Chat
The lobby chat is a public chat that is visible while you are in the lobby.  All users currently in the lobby will receive messages you send, and can send messages to you.  Type your messages in the bottom section of the lobby chat window and press the Send button in the window or the Enter button on your keyboard to send messages.

### Private Chats
Private chats are one-on-one chats with other players.  You can participate in private chats at any time while using BAAC: in the lobby, while playing a game, and while observing a game.  You can participate in as many private chats as you like!  
You can start a new private chat from either the main menu or in-game menu.  Once you select Start Private Chat, you will be prompted to select the user you would like to chat with.  Once you've chosen a chat partner, a new private chat window will appear with your chat partner's name in the title bar.  Type your messages in the bottom section of the private chat window and press the Send button in the window or the Enter button on your keyboard to send messages.
