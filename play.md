# Playing a Game
Once you've chosen Start Game or Join Game from the main menu in the lobby, you will be taken to the On Table screen showing the in-game menu and a game board  Your initial interaction with this screen will depend on which selection you made on the main menu

### Starting a Game
If you chose Start Game from the main menu, you will see an empty game board and a dialog window will let you know that you're waiting for an opponent.  You cannot interact with the game board during this time, but you can still start and participate in private chats.  Once another player joins, you will be asked if you're ready to play, and then the game will begin!

### Joining a Game
If you chose Join Game from the main menu, you will see an empty game board and immediately see a dialog window asking if you're ready to play.  Once you select Yes, the game will begin!

## Gameplay
Once the game has started, you will be assigned a color (black or red) and the game board will show game pieces.  If you are assigned black, it will be your turn first, and a dialog window will let you know that it's your turn.  If you are assigned red, you will have to wait until the other player moves.

### Making Moves
When it's your turn, a dialog window will appear informing you that it's your turn.  At this point, click on the square containing the piece you want to move, and then click on the square you'd like to move that piece to.  It's as simple as that!  
If you click a piece and decide you'd like to move a different one before you've made a move, click the same piece again and then click the piece you'd like to move, followed by the location you'd like to move that piece to.  
Once you make a move, your opponent will be informed that it's their turn, and you can just sit back planning your next move until you see another dialog box telling you it's your turn.  
This back and forth will continue until one of you is victorious!

### Bad Moves
If you make an invalid move, you will see a dialog message you informing you that your move was invalid, and the piece you moved will be placed back at its original location.  Then, another dialog window will tell you it's your turn and you can make your move!

## In-Game Menu
The in-game menu has only two options: Start Private Chat and Exit Game.  You can start a private chat with any player logged in to the server at any point.  See the [Chatting](chat.md) page for more info.  
You can also exit the current game at any time and you will be taken back to the lobby.
